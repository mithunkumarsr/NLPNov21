But this twin otter plane of 12 - 15 seats is undoubtedly the best for sightseeing an archipelago -LRB- island group -RRB- like Maldives .
One does n't come to know when it rise in air while running like speed boat on the surface water .
In the entire flight you do not feel the experience of ordinary flights .
All the time your eyes keep looking down out of the window - gazing at resort islands of Maldives in blue water of different shades and coral islands .
Everything is visible so clearly .
There are only two sea plane companies in Maldives .
Trans Maldivian is one of them which has 20 sea planes .
If you want then in around four thousand rupees -LRB- per person -RRB- you can do air tour for an hour or can hire a complete sea plane for day long roaming around -LRB- only if your pocket is heavy -RRB- .
If you go to some other island separate from Malé island then journey of sea plane would be important this is the only mode of journey amidst various islands .
And that is one such journey that your heart will never approve of its end .
Sea plane do journey of 12 kilometres to 183 kilometres -LRB- Mavilevaru in north -RRB- in the islands of Maldive .
We were in the largest antique and souvenier shop of the capital in Ahmadi market of Malé .
All salesmen were listening carefully the speech given by president Mohammad Nasheed in World climate conference a day before in Copenhagen .
If I say with honesty then I have never seen any Indian hear speeches of Presidents or Prime ministers so carefully .
But when there is a question of the very existence of a unique creation of earth then this much seriousness was incumbent upon .
many people might have considered the meeting held underwater by the cabinet of Maldive a façade , but on going to Maldive it feels that if natural calamity snatch it from us then the world will become so poor .
Something as special is tehre in the beauty there .
As if so much of beauty does not gather in this tiny country .
While returning towards the jetty to go back to cruise after that stroll of market , when the gaze suddenly went in the water of ocean moving along side the road then felt that to what extent people here understand the value of beauty here .
The water was so clear that fishes swimming below in depth of many metres were visible in all their colors in the light of lamp-post .
This was that part of the ocean which was right next to the city .
If you are able to see clear even some centimetres in the water of ocean or river abutting to any city of India then will find yourself lucky .
While returning to MV Aquamarine the two hours of evening spent in Maléy were roaming in our mind .
Coral reef is the life here .
To this point that you will find coral even on stones on graves .
A little while before listening to president Nasheed ' s speech we were standing outside his government residence .
Could not believe that we were in front of the residence of the supreme persona of a certain country , no security guard till far .
With much pleasure we were clicking photographs by extending our hand from inside the gate of the bungalow at a distance of mere fifty kilometres .
Can you think of this about the house of a petty leader in India ?
Got to know this as well that President at times reaches his office two blocks ahead crossing roads on foot .
Every thing about Maldive was overwhelming .
This is why I was waiting restlessly for the next day .
There was a hunch that the day was going to be special .
In the morning one boat brought us to Airport island from the cruise .
From there while circling around runway we reached on the base of Trans Maldivian .
Last evening when cruise was nearing Malé then we immediately recognized the sea plane passing from above .
We had seen so many pictures of it .
But then there was no likelihood that we would get a chance to ride in it .
We were to go to one hundred five kilometres far Rangali island by the sea plane of Trans Maldivian .
To see thousands of resorts and coral islands scattered in sea from the sea plane flying till the height of around thousand metres was unforgettable .
This beauty of water will not be found anywhere else .
That flight was a breathstopping one with thrill and enthusiasm .
But on reaching Conrad resorts of Hilton Hotels on Rangali siland it felt as if we reached in some other world .
In such a world that had no association with any outside world .
Association was also not such that finding something with beauty or luxury like that would be difficult outside .
Sauntering on Conrad road can be done on foot as well as through battery operated car .
While going on to the main island from Jetty the scene of life on both the sides of bridge was marvellous .
We had not even been able to make oursleves easy with the nature around , that we reached such place , was unimaginable .
While descending down in sea water through stairs many metres below we reached in such a room of glass water which was inside water .
This room was actually a dining room .
All around across glass we could see remarkable kind of small and big fishes , corals , humans doing snorkelling and scuba diving .
The imagination of eating food sitting on decorated tables there was thrilling in itself .
The fare on coming to this island in this sea plane from Maléon , on seeing it and having lunch underwater is 47 thousand rupees for one person .
there was no wish to return from there .
We were ready to float our passports in water .
But knew it was not possible .
With heavy heart we returned with this hope that at some time at some turn fortune will bring us here again for sure .
Were making a plan to go out of Delhi since many days but due to the busy work schedule this was not being possible .
Since childhood had an inclination towards wildlife so thought that why not this time Jim Corbett be visited .
After biking till Pegong lake ahead of Khardungla pass in Ladakh in 2006 this was second bike tour .
On the morning of 27 September we set out for Jim Corbett from Delhi but the enthusiasm with which we set out fog had scudded out our speed .
The journey between Hapud to Gajraula was really tiresome .
On top of this fog and broken road ahead .
Many a time it felt that now we will fall .
Somehow reached Gajraula at 8 in the morning .
Anyway we reached Ramnagar at 12 .
Corbett park is 20 kilometres ahead of Ramnagar .
Our resort was in Dhikuli near park booking of which we had got done before only .
That day there was no special program despite cold we first went to roam on the bank of Kosi .
After spending two - three hours we set out for Corbett museum which was near Dhangdi gate hardly 2 kilometres away .
From there we went to see Ramnagar down .
While returning it became late evening .
I had left delhi after avowing that I will see a free roaming lion in forest for sure then entire night in dreams lions continued to be seen in dreams .
In the middle of the depth of night a strong roar was heard by me and after that dogs began to bark so loudly that till two hours they did n't stop .
Therefore came the advice to visit first Kaladhungi and Corbett fall .
Kaladhungi is thirty kilometres far whereas Corbetts lie on the way of fall .
In Kaladhungi there is museum of Jim Corbett Sahib where some important things related to his private life are kept .
It struck half past twelve while returning back .
Kaladhungi is an extremely beautiful place , Jim Corbett settled in this place only .
On reaching Resort safari gypsy was waiting for us .
It was told that facility of siting was done in number one site Bijraani there .
On asking about number one we were told that grassland are more there and during this time tiger come that side only to escape from cold .
We were given a guide on reaching Bijrani who takes Rs . 250 for making us roam .
We set out for forest inside .
There we saw animals of various kinds and many species of deers .
We saw two tusker elephants inside who had very long tusks .
I photographed profusely .
Amidst all this the guide began to track tiger .
Guide told us that there are only around 150 tigers in the park , of them some have died lately .
At many places we saw their paw prints but I was upset for not being able to find the sight of tiger .
Third day we had to return to Delhi .
In my brain the furor of tiger was running heavy .
Suddenly then I remebered an old friend of mine of Haldwani .
I called him just like that only .
I told him that I have come to Corbett .
He asked you saw tiger or not .
These words pricked like an arrow .
I slowly said no .
There was no permission to take bike inside the park .
Somebody advised us that we should take safari for inside .
