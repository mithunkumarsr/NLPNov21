By eating fish not only your skin , hair , brain remain healthy but eyes also sharpen .
Omega-3 fat found in fish decreases the danger of glaucoma and weak eyes in old age .
Not only this , it saves you from dry eye syndrome .
It is stated in another study that women suffering from ophthalmic problems such as dry eye syndrome can decrease this problem up to 68 percent by eating tuna fish .
The use of dry fruits etcetera in Indian cuisines has been continuing for centuries .
But do you know that all the dry fruits such as almond , cashew nut , walnut , raisins etcetera are also very beneficial for eyes besides being nutritious .
Plenty of vitamin-B is found in these , which not only saves from cataract , many kind of blindness and other eye diseases but also protect eyes from the harms of ultraviolet rays .
Start eating pieces of dry fruits in sweets daily at the time of breakfast or meals .
Whether it is about dropping weight or care of skin , the advice of fresh fruits in meals is given in all the cases .
So , why should it be left for eyes .
The danger of glaucoma , cataract , and blindness can be decreased to a great extent by taking diet rich in vitamin-C .

H . . . stands for ` Human Immuno-deficiency Virus ' .
H . . . attacks the immune system of the body .
Immune system is such a system of arrangement in our body that saves us from infection .
Immune system identifies the disease-carrier or ` external invaders ' like virus , bacteria , etc and kills them .
H . . . is a virus which attacks the immune system , specially CD-4 cells and destroys them .
CD-4 cells help protect the body from different diseases .
What happens when a person gets infected with the H . . .
By entering into CD-4 cells the HIV increases its number very fast by reproducing and during this new viruses gets born in the cells .
With this the CD-4 cells get divided .
With the division in the CD-4 cells many viruses enter into the blood-circulation .
After this the H . . . attacks other CD-4 cells , and this process is repeated again and again .
H . . . destroys most of the CD-4 cells and thus the immune system of infected person gets destroyed .
Do get H . . . tested .
H . . . test is easy , safe and available at public health centres .

Because the internal scene is seen expanded on the screen of the television and is seen clearer directly .
Because of only four holes being made the possibility of these wounds getting ripened or infected becomes very less .
The patient stays on bed for about a week after simple surgical operation .
In such a situation they might have to face complexities like pneumonia , clotting in the blood vessels .
These possibilities are negligible in laparoscopy method .
Laparoscopic method takes double time in comparison with the simple treatment .
Patients are administered more anesthetic medicine which has its own harms .
Key hole surgery ' is a revolutionary invention in the field of surgery and more and more patients are being benefited with it .
The virus that can decrease the immune strength of the humans to fight diseases is called HIV .

On moving a little more ahead downwards Gangamaya sorrounded by mountains was found .
The magic of waterfalls between rocks is worth seeing .
We found in rock gardens that if waterfalls are magnificent in the empire of stones - rocks here then the magical world of waterfalls in Ganga maya is ornate with stones .
Both these places are placed very low among the mountains of Darjeeling .
By rising up with the help of car we saw Batusiya loop in Darjeeling .
From here wit the help of binoculars complete mountain of Darjeeling and city can be seen .
The mood of the weather was clean uptill now .
But as soon as reached the monastery , do n't know from where did a mass of black cloud presented itself and begin to shower .
Plan was made to shop and strolling on mallroad .
Tou trains enhance the journey in the tour of Darjeeling .
The journey for Darjeeling to Dhooma dn from Dhoom to Darjeeling is a special attraction for tourists .
Boating in Mirik lake here and a short break in garden .
From this route tourists go to Pasupathinath temple as well , where hand made sweaters ets are found by Napelese artisans .
Thee is arrangement to go to Kalimpong from Darjeeling city .
Although Kalimpong is a city of Darjeeling city only , but its appearnebce is different .
Here not the greenery of tea estates , but the commuting of forests - waterfalls is there .
The most popular tourist spot of Kalimpong are - Lava and Lolegaon which are filled with forests and rapids .
But due to lack in time we could not go to Kalimpong this time .
We had come to Darjeeling from Kolkata to roam around Darjeeling in the shadow of coolness but the tea estates spread from siligudi to Darjeeling here tied me to themselves .
A small journey of mine recently was very interesting and thrilling .
This journey was neither of a foreign nation nor of outside Rajasthan but of very near to Jaipur .
Tourism is an interesting subject in itself in which sometimes journey pull you towards itself , then at some time some special place , it may be a ship or a royal train or a city like pink city or the lake palace of Udaipur .
Because of some one attraction people come allured .
The place that I am going to talk about is prepared only about four and a half years ago , but with the preparation this place has come there it has actually brough bliss in the forest .
Not only for those going there but also for those staying there .
In my ears words of my guide Ram Babu Meena echo : Saahiba befor ethis we could not even think that we can stay like thisin forest .
Fifty percent of staff is of this area .
Suddenly I felt that these many people did n't get work even in heritage hotel .
Ajabgadh resident Raambabu used to work in Jaipur before this and now in this unique aman Bagh with royal style .
He has moulded his life style in a new color .
Sahiba ' is the style of Aman Bagh .
Here nobody calls you by the English form of address .
Aman Baag is in real a getaway with peace calm and all comforts and facilities .
This garden also has its own history and the best point is it introduces you to the nearby areas as well .
Among the ones spending holidays in Rajasthan in a royal way how many would have visited Bhaangadh of ghosts Why should I go far , among Jaipurites as well perhaps only one or two must have spent a night there .
After the opening of Aman Bagh big personas of our nation and abroad reached here .
I remember that night as well when Shabana Azmi had called me from all her heart there but I could not go .
It 's a different matter that she herself reached Bhaangadh after losing way .
This time I reached there suddenly at a feast by a foreign guest so felt that those people who want to spend a fantastic holiday in less time should come here for sure .
This is the only left garden among those seven gardens where the kings of Alwar used to camp for hunting .
It 's construction was done in nineteen hundred and twenty .
Its old wall is the witness of those days .
The first glimpse of Aman bagh surrounded with mountains and under the shadow of dense trees allure your heart .
The moment you enter inside the way you are welcomed , it appears from that only that here attention has been paid to divine peace .
Along with binding mauli in the wrist the mantra of mangalachar is chanted live .
we reached at sunset and we made a mind of taking a round of that garden .
My host Jackie who has been a decorator uttered suddenly ' This is interesting ' .
Everything is inspired from forts and palaces .
Themost beautiful is its lighting .
Everything is new but artisitc It was not surprising that Aman Bagh has received an award recently .
Manager fixed our program for the morning .
First of all a walk with Ram Babu and the Jeep journey of Bhaangadh .
While walking on the narrow road we saw the fort of Ajabgadh on which rays of sun were spreading gradually .
Saw a dry lake in which farmers were farming .
This year it did n't rain but first time saw tobacco farming .
Such a glimpse of village life was a wonderful experience for Jackie .
After this we reached Bhaangadh by Jeep .
Early morning I had seen a tourist from Holland sitting in deep meditation .
This is a million dollar priceless moment .
Aman Bag 's way of bidding farewell was also traditional they bid us farewell by making us eat jaggery and curd .
Now I understood that why a tourist come over here after spending so much .
I have heard , tour packages are organized to show tribal life as well .
Is it right .
Woithout doubt and this this happens not in one but many nationsand tourist show much interest also in them .
These tour are usually prepared for a time period of four days to two weeks and during this time tourists are taken to different places .
Lodging , meals etc are alo included in it .
This way there is an attempt to explore such places , where much development has not taken place and a cinsiderable effect has not been on the nature and lifestyle of people .
Along with where old tourists sites etc are also present .
Apart from this , care is taken on serving traditional cuisine as well .
Actually , the motive of such tours is to bring tourists face to face with the life style , ways and traditions of that place .
I Although it looks a little difficult on thinking but such tours are actually interesting and provide with a very different kind of experience .
There is a different joy of a bus tour .
With it you can enjoy of roaming alone despite being with so many people .
Not only this , in this journey you can give a lot of time without disturbing your favorite book .
Yes , this much is there that along with giving less expense and plenty of time filled with comfort these tour demand patience out of you for sure .
This is the reason that to enjoy them there are some points to be taken care of , specially then , when you are seeing some foreign destination through a bus tour .
Before buying a ticket search for the best deal .
Students , senior people of ministry , kids etc get a discount on it , then arrangement of discount for two people is also there .
Buying a ticket in advance is cheaper , this is why it is better to plan a little early than planning a bus tour in last moments .
Instead of two way trip enquire about round trip .
They are inexpensive .
Rules are strict regarding baggage , this is why enquire about the size and weight of luggage .
It might not happen that some luggage has to be left at the terminal or extra fee has to be paid .
Also also learn about the rules of insurance or loss coverage from the tour company .
Carry on bags are good , take them .
Because they fit in racks above the seat .
Also take care of the point that during the tour while changing the bus responsibility of luggage will be your own .
whre you have to take bus from , reach there an hour before time .
During busy season take special care of this point .
Actually , the early you reach , the better seat options you will have .
Mind comfort while chosing a seat .
You will experience more bumps at the back seat , and reading at front seat is not comfortable .
If you have to go to toilet frequently then take the corner seat and if you do not like to get much distrubed then window seat will be better for you .
Now a point of craftiness .
If you are looking for capturing both , then sit on the corner sit early and keep your bag on the second one .
If there is not much crowd in the bus then the planning will be successful .
If there is facility of washroom in the bus then do take care of this while chosing the seat because after a while it becomes difficult to sit there .
Establish a familiarity with the bus driver and conductor .
In this way you will get much important information from them .
During the cleaning of bus everyone is asked to go out of the bus .
During this time do not leave your stuff on the seat , because bus officials do not take its responsibility on its loss .
Wherever the bus stops , come back in time .
If you do not come in time thenn your place can be given to new passanger and you will have to wait for another bus at the terminal .
